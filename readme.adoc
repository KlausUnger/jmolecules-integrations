= jMolecules -- Technology integrations

This repository contains a variety of integrations of jMolecules abstractions into different technologies.

== Supported technologies
* link:jmolecules-archunit[`jmolecules-archunit`] -- ArchUnit rules that verify the aggregate structures in your model.
* link:jmolecules-bytebuddy[`jmolecules-bytebuddy`] -- A ByteBuddy plugin to translate jMolecules patterns implemented in `jmolecules-ddd` into different technologies. See the link:jmolecules-examples/jmolecules-spring-data-jpa[example] for details.
** Spring -- translates jMolecules annotations like `@Service` etc. into the Spring equivalents so that the annotated classes can be used out of the box with Spring.
** JPA -- translates `jmolecules-ddd` annotations and interfaces into default mapping annotations and boilerplate code required by JPA.
* link:jmolecules-integration/jmolecules-spring[`jmolecules-spring`] -- A ByteBuddy plugin to derive Spring component annotations for code that expresses DDD building blocks via `jmolecules-ddd`.

== Examples
* link:jmolecules-examples[`jmolecules-examples`] -- A collection of examples to showcase the usage of the concept types and annotations as well as the technology integration.
